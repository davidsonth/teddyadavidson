        <h3 className='body'>This website is a NodeTS React project and is hosted on a webserver that I rent. 
        
        I originally liked the idea of having a webpage, as I appreciated Web 1.0 asthetics and the idea of having an internet presence beyond social media. 
        
        It also has skill building and professional applications to have a website, and so I decided to construct this personal webpage. </h3>
