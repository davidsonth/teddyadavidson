        I'm a computer science and computer engineering student 
        at Northeastern, and I'm interested in a career in 
        networking and cloud computing. I'm from Sherborn, 
        Massachusetts, and have created this site to showcase 
        academic, professional and personal projects that I have 
        been working on the past couple of years.  </h3>

        Thanks for stopping by this page! My home page contains
        a bit about my interests, hobbies and such, but you can 
        find WORK_EXPERIECE, SKILLS_EXPERIENCE, and projects I've
        worked on as well.
